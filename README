ABOUT

Windy City is a style for biblatex that formats notes, bibliographies,
parenthetical citations, and reference lists according to The
Chicago Manual of Style. It accurately handles a wide range of
citations and includes a set of options and commands to accommodate
special circumstances. It also has extensive support for citing and
arranging different kinds of editors, translators, and compilers
within a single citation. These features make Windy City especially
suitable for academic work.
