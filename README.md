## ABOUT

Windy City is a style for [biblatex](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex)
that formats notes, bibliographies, parenthetical citations, and
reference lists according to [The Chicago Manual of
Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). It accurately
handles a wide range of citations and includes a set of options and
commands to accommodate special circumstances. It also has extensive
support for citing and arranging different kinds of editors,
translators, and compilers within a single citation. These features
make Windy City especially suitable for academic work.
